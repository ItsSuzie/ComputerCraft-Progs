-- This is the primary terminal.
-- Get input from the user asking if they want to use the auto blaze farm
-- (Maybe even just use a button to send redstone signal, and then check for signal).

-- When user information is get, send rednet signal (ideally ofer wire for security)
-- To the attacking turtles.

-- I remember something about this project. I had to use floppy disks to turn on a couple of the turtles.
-- I think i couldn't just "activate" the attack turtles from rednet, but rather had to use a system of floppy disk
-- giving. where the attack turtle connected to a floppy disk reader would check for input. if it get's input, it would
--  attack. But send floopy over to it, i had to use another turtle to send the floppy over and take it back. I think. 
--  and the attacking turtle used a startup program that would only run if it got floppy input.
